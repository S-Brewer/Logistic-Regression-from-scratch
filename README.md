### Logistic Regression
The goal of this project is to practice creating a logistic regression model.  
For this practice project, I am going predict whether a titanic passenger survived or not, using the Titanic dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinicius150987/titanic3  
I will be creating a logistic regression model from scratch, so I will not be using libraties like Tensorflow or PyTorch.  
However, I'll be using pandas and numpy, because they make vector calculations quicker, matplotlib for visualization, and train_test_split from sklearn to split my data.  
I will be using the material that I learned from the Coursera course 'Machine Learning Specialization': https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction  
And from this Standford lecture video that I found on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqKaVgQxEJ0"# Logistic-Regression-from-scratch"
